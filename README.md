# [Bookmark Landing Page - Frontend Mentor](https://vedantmali05.github.io/bookmark-landing)

My challenge was to build out this Bookmark Landing Page provided by [Frontend Mentor Challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) and get it looking as close to the design as possible. This project features all sections of a landing page header, tab slider for features, FAQs accordions, and footer with email.
